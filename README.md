# BasicDiscordBot
A basic template for creating discord bots.

This is a template made using the instructional guide from https://docs.stillu.cc/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html
This is the minimal amount of code to run a functional bot that is simply able to authenticate access into a discord server and log some fatal errors.

Prerequisites:
1. A new application must be made on the Discord Development Portal
2. Use OAuth Token to gain access to an existing Discord server
3. Need a access token

Things to do when adopting this template:
1. Change the namespace
